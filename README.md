# Warped_City
An example of polymorphism and inheritance used in action in the Android version of my newest game project. Used to print props in the environment. 

Prop.java is the main surclass with CokeSign.java, SushiSign.java, and BannerNeon.java being the child classes. I utililzed this to shorten code and optimize the printing
of items/props on screen. Map.java contains the main game environment class with RenderMap.java being the render methods for objects within that class.

*Just code snippets; I'll likely upload the project in its entirety in the near future
